COMS 3270
Assignment 1.08
---
This assignment adds in custom monsters and items to the game.

Items are read in via the default path ~/.rlg327/object_defs.txt, and are randomly placed across the dungeon (10 to 15, unless
 overriden with the -ni/--numitems flag). They may stack (displayed as a '&') when multiple items are present on the same
 tile. The PC can pick up an item (if stacked, the top one) by standing on it and pressing ','. It can store a maximum of 10
 items. Monsters can pick up/destroy items if they have those attributes set. If allowed to pick up, they keep as many items as
 they walk over and drop them all in a stack when they die. Items also are stored in the fog-of-war seen map, so they're rendered
 even as the player walks out of sight.

Monsters are now read in via the parser at default path ~/.rlg327/monster_defs.txt. Instead of the randomized hex monsters,
 they now have their own symbol, attributes, speed, and color(s). In addition, there are a few new attributes which are implemented:
  PASS (internally "ghost") which allows it to pass through walls without tunneling
  UNIQ which prevents a monster from appearing twice in the same dungeon or regenerating ever again when killed
  BOSS which, when killed, results in a game win
  PICKUP which allows the monster to pick up and store items when it walks over them
  DESTROY which makes the monster destroy any item it walks over
With this change, the monster menu has been revamped. It now allows the user to select a monster, displaying its name, description,
 and attributes at the bottom of the screen.
As mentioned, the game no longer ends when all monsters on a level are dead -- instead, it ends when the PC either dies
 or kills a monster with the BOSS attribute, or SpongeBob SquarePants.

Implemented controls:
    PC Movement:
      7, y: up left
      8, k: up
      9, u: up right
      6, l: right
      3, n: down right
      2, j: down
      1, b: down left
      4, h: left
      5, <space>, .: don't move
    Staircases:
      >: go down stairs
      <: go up stairs
    Monster menu:
      m: open the monster list
      <up arrow>: move selection up (if possible)
      <down arrow>: move selection down (if possible)
      <esc>: exit (ncurses adds a 1s delay here)
    Teleport:
      t: enter teleport mode/confirm
      r: teleport randomly
    Fog of War:
      f: toggle fog of war for this turn
    Items:
      ,: Pick up the top item at the PC's location
    General:
      Q: quit the game

Compile:
    Run: make
    This will generate an `assignment1_09` binary.

Flags:
    -s, --save: Saves the randomly-generated dungeon to the set path.
    -l, --load: Loads a dungeon from the set path and prints it.
    -dp, --dungeon-path [path]: Overrides the default dungeon path, ~/.rlg327/dungeon.
    -ip, --item-path [path]: Overrides the default item defs path, ~/.rlg327/object_defs.txt.
    -mp, --monster-path [path]: Overrides the default monster defs path, ~/.rlg327/monster_defs.txt.
    -n, --nummon [num]: Overrides the default randomized monster count.
                        Note that this will be used instead of the randomized
                        count in every dungeon generated by using staircases.
    -ni, --numitems [num]: Overrides the default randomized item count.
                        Note that this will be used instead of the randomized
                        count in every dungeon generated by using staircases.
    -d, --debug: Prints debug messages while loading/saving.
                 Also generates a "dungeon.pgm" hardness map after loading.
    -h, --help: Displays a help message.

Run:
    ./assignment1_09
