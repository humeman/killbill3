Assignment 1.01
---

This program creates a randomly-generated 80x21 dungeon. It consists of stone ( ), 6-10 rooms (.)
completely connected by hallways (#), and an up/down (><) staircase randomly placed within rooms.
These staircases will never block the entrance to a hallway. Each generated room will be 3x4 or larger. 
The one-cell border around the entire dungeon is considered immutable, and will not have any rooms or halls placed on it. 
The dungeon cells are stored in a dynamically allocated struct with a type, hardness, and mutable flag. The hardness
is not currently used. The program will log errors to stderr and exit if some action cannot be taken.

    make

Run:
