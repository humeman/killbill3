Assignment 1.04
---

This assignment builds upon the past assignments by adding monsters and a game loop.
The PC and all monsters are now modeled under a "character" struct (as mentioned looking ahead in 1.06),
which contains an optional pointer to a "monster" struct for monster type characters.
Each character has a speed, and the game takes the lowest priority next turn based on that speed,
 moves the character according to its attributes, and if that turn was for the PC redraws the screen.
A character kills another character if it tries to move into its space.
The PC wins if no characters are left; it loses if it gets killed.
The PC will move around randomly onto non-stone spaces in the dungeon whenever it is its turn.
Monsters will move according to any of the following (randomly added) attributes, based on the hex code
 that the monster displays (where bit 3 = ERRATIC, 2 = TUNNELING, 1 = TELEPATHIC, 0 = INTELLIGENT):
 - INTELLIGENT: Able to move according to the shortest path maps.
 - TELEPATHIC: Always moves to the PC, whether it can see it or not. Otherwise, requires line of sight.
                Line of sight applies if there is a straight line from a monster to the PC without any
                stone in the way.
 - TUNNELING: Can dig through stone.
 - ERRATIC: 50% chance to move randomly (either into stone, if allowed, or onto a regular cell).

Load/save still works. You can also still specify a custom path with -p/--path.
You can specify a number of monsters with -n/--nummon, the default is 10.
You can also override the FPS (effectively PC turns per second) with -f/--fps, the default is 4.

Compile:
    Run: make
    This will generate an `assignment1_04` binary.

Flags:
    -s, --save: Saves the randomly-generated dungeon to the set path.
    -l, --load: Loads a dungeon from the set path and prints it.
    -p, --path [path]: Overrides the default path, ~/.rlg327/dungeon.
    -n, --nummon [num]: Overrides the default monster count, 10.
    -f, --fps [fps]: Overrides the default FPS, 4.

    -d, --debug: Prints debug messages while loading/saving.
                 Also generates a "dungeon.pgm" hardness map after loading.
    -h, --help: Displays a help message.  

Examples (relevant to this assignment):
    # Regular game (random dungeon, 10 monsters, 4 fps)
    ./assignment1_04

    # Spawn 15 monsters
    ./assignment1_04 -n 15

    # Spawn 15 monsters, print 100 frames per second
    ./assignment1_03 -n 15 -f 100
