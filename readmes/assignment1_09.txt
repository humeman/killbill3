Assignment 1.09
---
This assignment fully implements items and combat in the game.

Items are still picked up by the player using the ',' key, which places them
 in the inventory slots (0-9). They can then equip items to their equipment
 slots with the 'w' key, which applies any bonuses to the PC. Only one item
 of a single type can be equipped, with the exception of 2 rings, so if one
 is already present they are swapped. Items can be taken off with 't', dropped
 with 'd', and expunged (deleted) with 'x'. Any of these will display a prompt
 with a list of relevant items on the screen.

An inventory menu was also added, accessible with 'I', 'i', or 'e'. It
 displays both the inventory and equipment slots side by side, and with the
 keyboard arrow keys or pressing [0-9a-l] an item can be selected, which
 displays its name, description, and bonuses at the bottom of the screen.

Full combat was also implemented. Whenever the PC attempts to move into a
 monster's space or vice versa, it'll deal the other damage to its hitpoints.
 Characters now only die when their HP drops to 0. The PC can randomly dodge
 attacks (if it has items that give it a dodge bonus). If a monster moves to
 another monster's space, the old monster is displaced to a nearby cell.
* The game also ends when a BOSS dies or the PC dies, as required in the spec,
   but I implemented that in 1.08.

Items now give bonuses to the player -- the four used at this point are speed,
 damage, defense, and dodge. Every eqipped item is applied to the PC's stats.
 Speed will be added to the PC's speed, making its turns come sooner.
 Damage will increase amount of HP damage dealt in attacks.
 Defense will reduce the HP damage taken from monsters' attacks.
 Dodge adds a probability (percent out of 100) that a monster's attack has no
  effect.

A message queue was also implemented to enable multiple messages per turn.
 It renders messages to the top of the screen in place of the old status
 string, in color using a color code system (&<num>, &b, &d, &r, &&,
 heavy inspiration from Minecraft). If multiple messages are queued,
 an arrow is displayed at the end, and ENTER will move to the next. The top
 message is auto-cleared on each PC input. If the player does nothing for
 2500ms, it is also auto-cleared.
