Assignment 1.06
---
This assignment ports the game to C++, and adds Fog of War and teleportation.

-> C++
All source files now compile as C++. Along with that, a lot of old C behavior
has been replaced with C++ equivalents:
- All structs are now classes, and where any functions were associated with a
   specific class they are now methods for that class.
- Inheritance is used for the character hierarchy.
- Where possible, int return codes are now thrown as exceptions. Functions
   that returned data via pointer arguments now return it directly.
- Other minor things, like some pass-by-reference and boolean variables.
Some structural changes were also implemented to clean up during this refactor:
- A game_t class handles all of the game logic. Character data has been moved
   out of the dungeon_t struct and into game_t. Initialization logic was also
   moved out of main and into game_t.
- File reading/writing was moved into the dungeon_t class.
- Removed some dependencies on character_t/dungeon_t elsewhere, so everything
   converges in game_t instead.

-> Fog of War
The player can now 'see' in a 2-cell (5x5) radius around the PC. These cells
 are rendered in color to represent that. When they can no longer see a
 previously-seen cell, the remembered state (regardless of what it is if it
 changes) is stored and rendered in grayscale.
Pressing 'f' will toggle on/off FoW for one turn -- when the PC moves/rests,
 it will re-enable regardless of the old state.

-> Teleportation
A teleportation mode was added. Pressing 'g' activates it, at which point
 the whole map becomes visible and a '*' pointer appears and can be moved.
Pressing 'g' again confirms the teleportation and moves the PC to the pointer.
Pressing 'r' in teleport mode at any time will pick a random floor location
 that's not occupied by a monster and teleport there.


Implemented controls:
    PC Movement:
      7, y: up left
      8, k: up
      9, u: up right
      6, l: right
      3, n: down right
      2, j: down
      1, b: down left
      4, h: left
      5, <space>, .: don't move
    Staircases:
      >: go down stairs
      <: go up stairs
    Monster menu:
      m: open the monster list
      <up arrow>: scroll up (if possible)
      <down arrow>: scroll down (if possible)
      <esc>: exit (ncurses adds a 1s delay here)
    Teleport:
      t: enter teleport mode/confirm
      r: teleport randomly
    Fog of War:
      f: toggle fog of war for this turn
    General:
      Q: quit the game

Compile:
    Run: make
    This will generate an `assignment1_06` binary.

Flags:
    -s, --save: Saves the randomly-generated dungeon to the set path.
    -l, --load: Loads a dungeon from the set path and prints it.
    -p, --path [path]: Overrides the default path, ~/.rlg327/dungeon.
    -n, --nummon [num]: Overrides the default randomized monster count.
                        Note that this will be used instead of the randomized
                        count in every dungeon generated by using staircases.
    -d, --debug: Prints debug messages while loading/saving.
                 Also generates a "dungeon.pgm" hardness map after loading.
    -h, --help: Displays a help message.  

Examples (relevant to this assignment):
    # Regular game
    ./assignment1_06

    # Spawn 15 monsters in each dungeon
    ./assignment1_06 -n 15

    # Load from a path for the starting dungeon
    ./assignment1_06 -l -p ~/dungeons/cool_dungeon.rlg327
