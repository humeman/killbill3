COMS 3270
Assignment 1.07
---
This assignment rips out the whole game stuff (temporarily) and gives a demo of monster and item parsing functionality.
It expects files at two paths:
    - ~/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt
    - ~/.rlg327/object_desc.txt
These must both follow the expected RLG327 monster/object description formats.

The files will be read, have all of their attributes parsed, and then be printed to the terminal one by one.
All of the monsters will be printed, then all of the items. Dashes will separate each individual entry and a header is
 printed above the monster/item sections.
Strict file validation is performed -- namely:
    - Headers must match
    - Keys must exist on the target monster/object
    - Values must match the rules defined in the assignment spec (ie, valid types, dice formatting, long string formats, ...)
    - No unexpected data can be added (must wrap in a BEGIN <> / END, nothing else in between besides whitespace)
    - No unexpected EOFs (long strings must be terminated with ., entries must terminate with END)
Exceptions are thrown and printed instead of the parsed data if anything is invalid.

Internally, the parser is a template class which can read into any struct. It accepts a list of attribute definitions
 including the name, offset within the struct, data type, and required flag for each allowed key/value. It also gets the
 expected header and expected object header for validation.
A number of generic parsers are added which allow us to parse each of the possible data types into whatever type fits best
 rather than just keeping a bunch of strings. These are called based on parser_definition_t.type.
This means that the code difference between parsing monsters and items is a few lines of configuration -- besides that,
 they work identically and use the same parsing class.

Compile:
    Run: make
    This will generate an `assignment1_07` binary.

Flags:
    None :)
    This assignment does not actually run the game, so no flags are read.

Examples (relevant to this assignment):
    ./assignment1_07
