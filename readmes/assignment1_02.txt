COMS 3270
Assignment 1.02
---

This program creates random 80x21 dungeons and enables them to be saved and loaded using the .rlg327 file format. 
All data from the file format is loaded and converted into the internal dungeon structure:
- Cells, into dungeon.cells as type enum, hardness = 0: CELL_TYPE_HALL, > 0: CELL_TYPE_STONE 
- Rooms, x0/y0 and width/height -> struct room, x0/y0 and x1/y1, area into dungeon.cells as CELL_TYPE_ROOM
- PC location, into dungeon.pc_x and dungeon.pc_y, and dungeon.cells at that location as CELL_TYPE_PC
- Up/down staircase count and x/y, into dungeon.cells as CELL_TYPE_[UP/DOWN]_STAIRCASE

When no flags are applied, a random dungeon is generated and printed to the terminal. With the save flag, a file
will be generated at the default path (~/.rlg327/dungeon). With the load flag, no dungeon will be generated -- instead,
it will be loaded and displayed from the default path. Using the -p/--path flag, the default path can be overridden.

Compile:
    Run: make
    This will generate an `assignment1_02` binary.

Flags:
    -s, --save: Saves the randomly-generated dungeon to the set path.
    -l, --load: Loads a dungeon from the set path and prints it.
    -p, --path [path]: Overrides the default path, ~/.rlg327/dungeon.

    -b, --border: Draws a border around the outside of the 80x21 area.
    -d, --debug: Prints debug messages while loading/saving.
    -h, --help: Displays a help message.  

Examples:
    # Just generate a dungeon and print it
    ./assignment1_02

    # Save the dungeon to the default path
    ./assignment1_02 -s

    # Load the same dungeon
    ./assignment1_02 -l

    # Save to a custom path
    ./assignment1_02 -s -p my_dungeon.rlg327

    # Load from a custom path, enabling a border and debug messages
    ./assignment1_02 -l -p my_dungeon.rlg327 -b -d
