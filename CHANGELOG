2/6: 
    1p:  Created files and basic layout for I/O and new main method
         Wrote logic for reading command-line flags
         Added extra flag, -p, for a custom path
2/10:
    9p:  Completed and tested loading functionality against sample files.
         Created a header file for general macros, macros.h.
         Added structure to main() to write files (although it currently
            returns an error code since it's unimplemented).
         Added a debug logging flag, -d/--debug.

-- ASSIGNMENT 1.1 --
2/3:
    9a:  Created project structure and makefile.
         Created some function signatures.
         Created an empty dungeon grid.
    10p: Added random room generation.
2/4:
    6p: Added walkways between rooms.
    8p: Added up/down staircases.
2/5:
    5p: Refactored dungeon into a dynamically-allocated data structure,
         containing width/height, room data, and cells.
        Also changed cells from a char into a struct with a type enum
         and hardness.
        Created dungeon_init and dungeon_destroy for allocation, tested
         for leaks with valgrind, and changed all methods to use this new
         structure.
        Added a random room count between pre-defined bounds. Extra rooms
         above the minimum, 6, may be added (if possible & chosen).
        Updated Makefile to compile files individually.
        Added immutable flag, and set it on the outside of the dungeon.
