BEGIN ENEMY bill
NAME Bill
COLOR YELLOW
DESC
He's gone and done it again -- he was revived a second time
since his defeat in Kill Bill 2. We're not sure if he's
real, AI, robot, or something in between. But he's returned
with a vengeance, more determined than ever to put an end
to the worthless scum that would dare challenge
Michaelsoft's goal of world technological domination.

BEGIN ENEMY robot
NAME Security Robot
COLOR BLACK
DESC
We think this is where all the Copilot training data went.
This is a new, even more violent breed of security robot
specially built by Bill's loyal employees. They immediately
sense the thoughts of those who reject Michaelsoft's
wonderful ideals, putting a swift end to them.
