BEGIN ENEMY bill
NAME Bill
COLOR YELLOW
DESC
He's gone and done it again -- he came back to life a
second time since his defeat in Kill Bill 2. We're not
sure if he's real, AI, robot, or something in between. But
he's returned with a vengeance, more determined than ever
to put an end to the worthless scum that would dare
challenge Michaelsoft's goal of world technological 
domination.

BEGIN ENEMY robot
NAME Security Robot
COLOR BLACK
DESC
We think this is where all the Copilot training data went.
This is a new, even more violent breed of security robot
specially built by Bill's loyal employees. They immediately
sense the thoughts of those who reject Michaelsoft's
wonderful ideals, putting a swift end to them.
