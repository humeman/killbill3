# COM S 3270 Project
## Dungeon Game
This repository contains the code for the semester-long assignment in COM S 3270 at Iowa State,
which will eventually be a complete dungeon game written in C++.

## Run
A Makefile is provided which compiles each individual assignment into a binary.
For example: `make assignment1_01` will create `assignment1_01`

## Submit
A submission target is provided in the Makefile to automatically create and test the submission tarball
for an assignment.
For example: `make submit assignment=1_01`

## Assignments
* **Assignment 1.01**: Random dungeon generator

    This program creates a randomly-generated dungeon with several rooms and corridors, and prints it out to the terminal.
